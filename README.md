**Proximity Anticheat**

A light and powerful anticheat module for Roblox.

**Disclaimer: This anticheat might have false positives, and you may need to tweak it to your game's needs, remember, this is the reason why Roblox doesn't have an anticheat, you understand the best on how your game works and you need to make your game's architecture safe!**

Usage Instructions:

Make sure your filetree in Roblox looks something like this, otherwise, worst case scenario is it will probably not work/work as intended.

**How it works**

Every frame of the game, Proximity AC iterates through the entire player list of your game and gets the player(s) characters and then uses a few functions to create "exploit data" for them, if any of the detection criteria is true, it kicks the player.

_______
**Feedback**

It is a constant struggle between exploit-makers and anti-exploit developers to fight together, one side makes the exploits, one side patches them. Help us make this anticheat better by providing feedback and reporting issues in the issues page. Your contribution helps a lot!

_______
**Short Note**

Please, if you're using this, consider supporting Syntax Studios, an indie game development studio and credit if you use this in your game, but it is your choice, completely fine if not. We're happy to help you.

Happy anti-exploiting!
